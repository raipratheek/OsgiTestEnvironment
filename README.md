# OsgiTestEnvironment
An OSGI based test set up for testing Application protocols like CoAP, MQTT and plain Websocket.
This is a simple test environment where I will be testing few of the IoT protocols. 
The protocol implementation considered here are open source implementations.

The tests are performed for a simple unicast client/server set up.
