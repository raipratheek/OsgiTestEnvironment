= Application Protocol Evaluation for an OSGi based Server/Client application running on constrained devices 

The Server/Client application under discussion in this
report has a layout as shown in the   figure below. The server has services
which could be accessed by the client delegates through an application
layer protocol. Application protocol handles all the data exchange activities between the two
applications through an IP (Internet Protocol) connection. The applications
could be running within the same device or separate devices connected through a
network. The server connects to only one client at a time which makes this a
Unicast set up.

This report deals with evaluating few of the IoT based application
layer protocols for the Unicast Server/Client setup with the Server application
running on an embedded device, capable of connecting to remote clients.

The evaluation is done on the following topics:

1) Suitability of the Application protocol to
the Server/Client structure under discussion.

2) Flight time vs Payload test for payload within 200kB.

3) Data sniffing with Wireshark to analyze traffic and packet size.

4) Speed tests on LAN and wireless LAN networks.

5) Ability to detect unexpected connection break.

**Test Setup:**

The test setup consists of an OSGi based server and a client
application. The applications could be bundled with protocol APIs like
CoAP, MQTT or Websocket. The application protocol APIs are plugged in to the server and the client application one at a time for detailed evaluation. The server application is run on the Raspberry Pi board and the
client application is run on the PC. The applications are tested on LAN network
and Wireless LAN network.

**Client**: The client
application has a simple UI which is built using the Eclipse RCP framework. The
client has a text editor where the test payload is entered and a URI
field where the address of the server application is entered. The client
connects to the server and on click of the send button sends the test payload
data from the text editor to the server using the protocol APIs under test. The
response from the server is analyzed and details like Flight time of the data,
the order in which the data is received from the server and the correctness of
the response is displayed.

The client provides synchronous data exchange where the
client waits for the response from the server and also provides asynchronous
data exchange where the client sends one request with additional time period
parameter T ms and the server then responds with the test payload every T ms
until the client sends a stop request.

**Server: **The
server application accepts the connection request from the client and responds
to the instructions from the client. The type of data that is exchanged between
the server and the client is JSON.

**1. Java Socket Programming**

**Java.net libraries **can
be used to establish a connection between the server and the client application
to** **exchange application data. The
connection provides input and output streams on either ends.

**Evaluation**

**Design with Java.net
libraries**

Since the Java socket connection is only a transport layer connection,
handling of application data needs to be taken care by the respective
applications. Hence our application architecture would look like the figure
below.

image::images\java_net_overview.png[]

**Request/Response Handlers**
are required on the server and the client side to handle request and responses.
The application data should contain some additional information to reach the
intended destination like RequestID,  ServiceID etc.

[underline]#Inference#: With Java.net library implementation there
are no definite protocol rules followed by the server and the client, hence
this solution does not offer extensibility. For a new client to communicate
with the server, it has to first understand server.

**Transport Layer
Tests:**

Since Java socket connection is a stream based connection,
there needs to be a mechanism to detect the start and end of a message. To
facilitate this short header of 6 bytes is added at the start of the message.
The header contains the total length of the message in bytes. Based on the size
of the message the bytes are read from the stream one by one until the end of
the message is reached.

[underline]#Inference:# For larger payloads the speed decreases
because the data is read from the stream one byte at a time. The speed can be
increased by reading chunks of data together from the stream instead of reading one byte at a time from the stream.

Tables below shows the results of reading chunks of dtat from the stream.

**[underline]#Sniffing with
Wireshark#**[underline]#:#

The figure below shows the log from Wireshark for a data
size of 184kBytes in a LAN network. Here we could see that the data transfer
from the client to the server is completed in 17ms. But from the above tests we
find the time taken for a payload of 184Kbytes is 710ms. This is because the
message is read from the stream one byte at a time.  

image::images\java_net_wireshark.png[]

**[underline]#Detection of
Connection Break#**: 

For detecting unexpected connection breaks, the client has
to keep polling with a “ping” request and the server responds with a “pong”. The
ping-pong messages need to be additionally handled in separate threads by the
Request/Response handlers.

If the client does not receive a pong response from the
server within a specified timeout, then a connection break notification is
triggered.

**Summary**

Advantages:

* Available
with standard Java SDK.

Disadvantages:

* Not an application layer protocol.

* Connection polling to check health of the
connection needs to be handled by the application.

* Data is exchanged using streams and no framing
mechanism available. 

**2. Constrained Application Protocol** 

**CoAP **is
an&nbsp;application layer&nbsp;protocol that is intended for use in
resource-constrained devices. CoAP is a REST based protocol with similar
methods that are similar to HTTP namely GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. Additionally
CoAP also supports asynchronous data transfer from server to client with the
Observe mechanism. The resources are reached with the URIs. 

**Californium (CoAP):**

**Californium** is an
open source implementation of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) and
is a part of the eclipse foundation for IoT.

**Type of License**: License
details from Californium website states“Californium
is dual-licensed under EPL (Eclipse Public License) and EDL (Eclipse
Distribution License). The latter is a BSD-like (Berkeley
Software Distribution) license, which means the Californium-CoAP framework can
be used together with proprietary code to implement your IoT product”.

**Minimum Java version:
**Java 1.7.

**Features of CoAP:**

* REST based protocol with
additional asynchronous data exchange capability and multicast capability.

* Supports HTTP like methods GET,
PUT, POST and DELETE for handling the server side resources. Additionally
Resources can be observed for changes and the client gets notified when the
resource is changed.

* Designed for constrained M2M
communication over low power unreliable networks.

* Provides REST based architecture
in a suitable form for the M2M communication.

* Provides 2 types of message
delivery Confirmable Message (CON) which guarantees delivery and Non
confirmable message (NON) which does not guarantee delivery.

* Limited overhead with fixed header
length of only 4bytes and additional header length of up to 8bytes + 2bytes for
message identifier. Which makes the header size <20bytes.

Since the protocol is developed
constrained devices in unreliable networks the Transport Layer protocol is UDP
with a layer built for reliability. But the protocol can also be extended to
support TCP and Websocket as Transport layer protocols.

Security is provided by the DTLS
(Datagram Transport Layer Security) connector over UDP.

Block-wise data transfer
capability for payloads greater than the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit). Block
size negotiations are possible between the Server and Client. 

**Features Available
with Californium CoAP:**

* Observe capability for
asynchronous data transfer from the server to the client.

* Block-wise data transfer for
larger payloads.

* Reliability layer built for
reliable data exchange over UDP.

* Secure DTLS connection available.


**Features not available
with Californium CoAP:**

* The TCP connection is still
under development.

* Websocket Transport layer
connection not available.

**Evaluation:**

**Design with CoAP:**

With CoAP the server side services could be implemented as
resources which have URIs and each of the services could be accessed by the
client delegates with the URI of the service. 

With CoAP the server classes can be accessed by the client
classes using the URIs of the server classes and data can be retrieved using
methods like GET, POST, PUT and OBSERVE.

image::images\coap_overview.png[]

[underline]#Connection:# A single Transport layer connection is
sufficient to handle multiple resources. The type of connection could be UDP,
TCP or Websocket.

[underline]#Inference:# CoAP is very well suited for the
Server/Client setup and offers modularity and extensibility. Since CoAP is a
REST based protocol there is no session data that is stored in the server. The
server classes are accessed by the client to retrieve data from the server.  

**Transport Layer
Tests:**

CoAP can be used with UDP, TCP and Websocket connections.
But Californium only offers UDP and TCP connections. Websocket connection is
not yet implemented.



**[underline]#Speed test for
different payloads:#** In this test the flight time is measured for
different payload sizes on Wired LAN and also Wireless LAN network.

|====================
TCP connection is found to be slightly slower than the UDP
connection. This is due to the addition Acknowledgement of the TCP protocol.

**[underline]#Sniffing with
Wireshark#**[underline]#:# 

Here the data that is exchanged between the server and the
client is sniffed using the Wireshark tool. The intercepted data is analyzed to
check the bandwidth consumed and the total number of bytes exchanged.


[underline]#Payload < 1024 Bytes#: For payload size less than
1024 bytes the complete payload is transferred with a single frame without
fragmentation. The total size of the CoAP packet in this case will be 1024Bytes
+ 4 Bytes of Fixed Header + 8 Bytes of 
Token +  few bytes of options + 1
Byte End of Option.

The header length of each CoAP Frame is usually 12 Bytes +
Number of Option Bytes. In the tests performed, it was observed that the header
length generally remains under 30 Bytes.

[underline]#Payload >1024 Bytes#: For payload size greater than
1024 bytes the payload body needs to be fragmented to fit one frame and each
fragmented chunk is called a “Block”. The size of each Block is 1024. After
each frame is sent an acknowledgement is expected and the next frame is only sent after
the acknowledgement is received. The total Frame size is found to be 1092
Bytes.

The size of each CoAP frame was found to be 1050 Bytes with
26 Bytes os CoAP header. The size of the Acknowledgement message is found to be
15 Bytes of header data and 0 bytes payload. 

image::images\coap_wireshark.png[]

[underline]#Inference#: 
Since CoAP is designed for constrained devices on unreliable network,
the speed of data transfer for smaller payloads (< MTU) is acceptable. But
as the size of the payload increases the speed decreases drastically. 

The blockwise data transfer in CoAP requires an acknowledgement
after each block. The maximum size of payload possible with a single block is
1024 bytes. Therefore to transfer 10kB of data 10 Blocks of data needs to be
sent with acknowledgement after each block. This process reduces the speed of
data transfer for larger payloads.

**[underline]#Detection of
Connection Break#**: 

With **UDP** there is
no longlasting connection that is established between the server and the client. Each datagram
carries the source and the destination information and the data is received by
the receiver based on the IP address carried by the datagram. 

But in CoAP there is a reliability layer that is built on
top of UDP. The reliability layer sends acknowledgement back to the sender when
a datagram is received thereby bringing conformity for the data sent.

Hence with UDP connection there needs to be some kind of
ping-pong mechanism (connection health polling) to determine whether
the peer is still available. Unfortunately this is not built into CoAP and the
application needs to take care of this.

With **TCP** unlike
UDP there is a longlasting connection that is established between the server and the
client. Therefore any unexpected connection error can be detected. With TCP a
simple ping-pong mechanism can also be set up by exchanging empty messages to
check the health of the connection.

**Summary**

Advantages of Californium CoAP:

* Californium CoAP provides
extensive APIs to implement the resources on the server side which can be
accessed with the URI. Hence making the application design straight forward.

* New features can be added to the
applications by just creating a new resource without any changes on the
existing code. 

* UDP and TCP connections are
available.

* Data security through DTLS and TLS
connections.


Disadvantages of Californium CoAP:

* Data transmission rate is slow for
payloads in the range of 10s of kBs with both UDP and TCP connection.

* Works best when the size of the
payload is within 1 kB.

* Websocket connection is not
available with Californium.

* Connection break or peer out of
reach cannot be readily determined with UDP connection.


**Further Development**

The data transmission rate can be improved when using
reliable transport layer protocols like TCP and Websocket. The draft https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-coap-tcp-tls-09[https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-coap-tcp-tls-09]
suggests BERT (Block-wise Transfer and
Reliable Transports) which improves the block-wise transfer of CoAP by using
the features offered by TCP. This feature can be implemented with Californium
to improve the data transmission rate for larger payloads. 


**3. Message Queue Telemetry Transport**

**MQTT** stands for
MQ Telemetry Transport. It is a publish/subscribe, extremely simple and
lightweight messaging protocol, designed for constrained devices and
low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks. The design principles are
to minimize network bandwidth and device resource requirements whilst also
attempting to ensure reliability and some degree of assurance of delivery.
These principles also turn out to make the protocol ideal of the emerging
“machine-to-machine” (M2M) or “Internet of Things” world of connected devices,
and for mobile applications where bandwidth and battery power are at a premium.

**Moquette MQTT **is
the Java implementation of the MQTT protocol for the server.

**Type of License: **Apache
License 2.0.

**Minimum Java Version:
**Java 1.7.



**Eclipse Paho Client **is
the MQTT Java implementation for the client.

**Type of License: **Apache
License 2.0.

**Minimum Java Version:
**Java 1.7.

**Features of MQTT:**

* MQTT is a Publish/Subscribe type
protocol with a Broker to handle data exchange between the clients.

* Can also be used in a server/client
set up by embedding the broker to the server.

* Built on TCP or Websocket
connection.

* Offers multiple Quality of Service
(QoS) like

 (QoS0) At most once delivery
 (QoS1) At least once delivery
 (QoS2) Exactly once delivery 
 
* Keeps the connection alive with
configurable ping-pong request response.

* Offers Will message where the
client tells the server what should be done in case the connection between the
server and the client closes.

* Limited overhead with fixed header
size of only 2 bytes. 

**Evaluation**

**Design with MQTT**

MQTT broker is designed for an environment where “one to many”
publication is required. Since we are dealing with a Unicast Server/Client
application, the MQTT Moquette api should be embedded with the server
application. The client subscribes for topics, for which it would like to get
the published messages. Each of the server side services corresponds to a
unique topic. The subscribe message from the client could act as the request
and the message published could be the response. To handle the subscription and
the publication of the topics a handler class is required to direct publish/subscribe
messages to the classes corresponding to the topic.

Moquette api depends in Hazelcast api to handle the
Publish/Subscribe mechanism on the application layer. The Request/Response handler
class could create an instance of HazelcastInstance for handling the Publish/Subscribe
messages.

image::images\mqtt_overview.png[]

[underline]#Inference#:
MQTT is well suited for a network of clients which interact with each other.
But for a simple Unicast Server/Client application a separate Request/Response
handler is required on either side and hence MQTT acts as an extension of the
Transport layer protocol it is built on namely, TCP and Websocket.

**Transport Layer
Tests:**

MQTT can be used with TCP or Websocket connection.

|====================
There is not much to choose between the TCP and the
Websocket connection in terms of speed of data transfer. But with Websocket
connection the payload size is limited to 64kB.

**[underline]#Sniffing with
Wireshark#**[underline]#:# 

MQTT provides message Fragmentation to fit the MTU of the IP
layer (usually 1500 bytes). If the message size is larger than 1MTU then the
message is fragmented before sending it. MQTT uses TCP as the transport layer
protocol and hence guarantees error free and sequential message delivery. 

[underline]#Inference#: MQTT offers a reliable and very high data
transfer rate for larger payloads. This is because large messages are
fragmented on the server side and sent as frames to the client, where it is
put together.

**[underline]#Detection of
Connection Break#**: 

MQTT offers extensive support to detect unexpected
connection break. To keep the connection between the server and the client
alive there is PINGREQ and PINGRES messages exchanged. The client sends PINGREQ
to the server when it detects inactivity (duration of inactivity is
configurable) and the server responds immediately with PINGRES message. If the
client does not receive the PINGRES then a connection break notification is
triggered. The frequency of the PINGREQ-PINGRES messages can also be
configured. The PINGREQ-PINGRES messages do not consume a lot of bandwidth as
they do not carry any payload. 

**Summary**

MQTT is best suited in a Multicast environment where a dozen
of devices are connected through a network and exchange data between them via a
broker application. The broker acts as the brain of the protocol and does
handling of subscriptions from the clients and publishing messages whenever
there is a message for a subscribed topic to the clients.

Advantages of Moquette MQTT:

* The data transfer for large
payloads is reliable and fast.  

* Offers different levels of QoS.

* TCP and Websocket connections are
available.

* Data security through TLS and
* Secure Websocket connections.

Disadvantages of Moquette MQTT:

* The Publish/Subscribe architecture
of MQTT is an overhead for a Unicast Server/Client application.

* 2 separate API required. Moquette
on the server side and Eclipse Paho client on the client side.

**4. WebSocket**

**WebSocket**&nbsp;is a computer&nbsp;communications
protocol, providing&nbsp;full-duplex&nbsp;communication channels over a single&nbsp;TCP&nbsp;connection.
The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the&nbsp;IETF.&nbsp; WebSocket is designed to be
implemented in&nbsp;web browsers&nbsp;and&nbsp;web
servers, but it can be used by any client or server application. The WebSocket
Protocol is an independent TCP-based protocol. Its only relationship to&nbsp;HTTP&nbsp;is
that its&nbsp;handshake&nbsp;is interpreted by HTTP servers as an&nbsp;Upgrade request.&nbsp;The WebSocket protocol enables interaction
between a browser and a web server with lower overheads, facilitating real-time
data transfer from and to the server.


**Java-Websocket by TTNate **is** **a barebone
websocket implementation in Java.

**Type of License**:
MIT.

**Minimum Java version**:
Java 1.4.

**Features of WebSocket**:

* Provides full Duplex communication
built over TCP.

* Uses only one TCP connection to
accomplish full Duplex communication.

* The size of the payload is not
limited.

* Same ports could be used to handle
HTTP and WebSocket i.e. 80 and 443.

* Not a fully fledged application
layer protocol but offers framing mechanism over TCP to enable transport of
payloads of any size.

**Evaluation**:
**Architecture with
WebSocket**

WebSocket is only a light weight wrapper around TCP which
offers full Duplex capability and Framing for large payloads. Hence in the
Server/Client set up it can be used as a substitute to Java Socket (Transport
layer protocol).

However using WebSocket provides additional features like 
* Notifies the server and the client
when there is an unexpected break in connection.

* Checks for inactivity in the
connection and exchanges Ping-Pong messages to keep the connection alive.  

* Either the Server or the Client
could close the connection.

* Full Duplex means that the Server
and the Client applications have equal control over the connection and can be
called peers.

|====================

**[underline]#Sniffing with
Wireshark#**[underline]#:# 

WebSocket is built on TCP and has a framing mechanism on top
of TCP . It uses IP packet mechanism to send frames of data over the network
and once the final frame is arrived the frames are put together. All of this
comes with a small overhead of 8 Bytes of WebSocket header size.

[underline]#Inference#: WebSocket offers a reliable connection
between the server and the client. The framing layer built on top of TCP helps
with transferring large payloads efficiently. The overhead is also very minimal
with a header size of 8 Bytes.

**[underline]#Detection of Connection
Break#**: 

The connection break can be easily determined when the
“ping” request does not receive a “pong” response. Since WebSocket is a full
Duplex connection, the “ping” request can be sent by any of the peers. The time
interval between the ping messages can be decided by the application. 



**Summary**

WebSocket could be used in place of Java Socket
implementation as a Transport Layer protocol which supports framing of data and
can handle payloads of any length and all of this comes at the cost of few
bytes of header length. It also supports full Duplex communication and detects
unexpected communication break. 

Advantages of WebSocket:

* The data transfer for large
payloads is reliable and fast.  

* Data security through TLS
connections.

* Full Duplex communication.

* Small header size.

* Supported by all the major web
browsers.


Disadvantages of WebSocket:

* Merely a Transport Layer protocol
on steroids. Does not support any Application Layer protocol features.
